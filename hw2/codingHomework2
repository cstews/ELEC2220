;Coding HW 2
;Try building the code below; as written, it will cause four errors.
;Using the class notes and the error cheat sheet (under Files on Canvas),
;fix these errors and make a note of what you did (just leave a comment
;saying what you changed).  Each fixed error is worth 0.2 points.

;Then, step through your newly working code using the debugger and
;answer the six questions written in the comments of the given
;code regarding register values and stored numbers.  Each of these
;questions is also worth 0.2 points each.
